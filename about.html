    <h2 style="text-align: center;" style="color: #16dad3;">Hi! This is Gwen and this is my story of why I chose I.T</h2> <hr>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">My brain operates on a "trial-and-error" basis, but instead of the "error" part, I've perfected the "trial" and then immediately getting bored with it. I'm a serial hobbyist, a connoisseur of fleeting interests. One month, I'm a DIY home décor guru, the next I'm a professional baker who can't be bothered to preheat the oven. My hobbies are like a new season of a TV show: I get really into it for a short time, then move on to the next big thing. The only one that has ever truly stuck around is reading. A novel is a commitment I can handle because there are endless stories to choose from, each one a fresh adventure for my easily-distracted mind. This fickle, flighty nature of mine made picking a college major a truly terrifying prospect. The last thing I wanted was to invest my time and money into something only to wake up six months later and realize I was utterly, irrevocably bored and regretted choosing it.</p> 
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">My first big plan was to join the police force. My childhood was basically a montage of me learning taekwondo and arnis, so I was convinced I was destined to be a crime-fighting hero. My parents, however, quickly shattered my dreams. "You're too short!" they'd say, as if my height was a magical barrier that would deflect any incoming bad guys. They also had a more reasonable concern about my safety, which I begrudgingly understood. My relatives, bless their hearts, tried to console me by suggesting I could be a desk cop, a sort of behind-the-scenes hero, but that just didn't have the same dramatic flair. The dream was officially dead.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Fast-forward to my early teenage years, and my attention shifted. I read a novel with a protagonist who was a genius programmer and a master hacker—the coolest character I'd ever encountered. I was instantly obsessed. I spent a month trying to teach myself programming and hacking from free websites, only to quit when my brain decided it was done with the whole "learning" thing. I'd move on to something else, but the lingering thought of technology, specifically the logic of code and programs, never left me. It was like the ghost of a past hobby, always haunting the back of my mind.</p> 
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">High school was another chapter in my grand exploration of what I wanted to be when I grew up. I joined the school's journalism club, where my role was to be the "proofreading police" for the school paper. I became a master of finding misplaced commas and misspelled words. This experience led me to believe I was meant to be a proofreader, a purveyor of the English language. I was ready to commit to a Bachelor of Arts in English, a decision that felt safe and predictable.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">But of course, the list didn't end there. I was also a physical activity enthusiast, which made me briefly consider becoming a P.E. teacher. Then there was the time I decided I should be an Electrical Engineer, all because my dad was an electrician and I had learned how not to get electrocuted. It seemed like a solid foundation. My friends, in a moment of pure observational genius, suggested I go into Human Resources, claiming my "observation skills" were top-notch. I had to laugh—it wasn't observation, it was just a natural talent for judging people. I'm a connoisseur of human behavior, and my talent for quickly assessing someone's quirks is more of a personality flaw than a skill.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After high school, I took a gap year—or, more accurately, a three-year "gap" that was more of a detour. I worked, and then I had a brief, ill-fated plan to study in Canada. We went through the entire process—school applications, visa paperwork—only for the Canadian government to reject me. My dream of becoming an international student was crushed, and the financial reality of it all meant we had to temporarily give up. That whole process ate up two more years of my life, leaving me three years behind my peers.</p> 
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After all that chaotic wandering, I finally took a good, hard look at what I wanted from life and what I could actually stick with. It dawned on me that Information Technology was the perfect fit for my uniquely indecisive personality. It’s a field with a constantly changing landscape, which means there’s always something new to learn. The demand is high, the pay is excellent (and who doesn't love money?), and a lot of the work can be done remotely. I'm a homebody at heart, so the idea of flexible hours and working in my pajamas was a major selling point.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Of course, it's not all sunshine and code. The cons are real: long hours, high stress, and the need for continuous learning. But after three years of navigating the real world and dealing with life's rejections, I've realized something: I'm good at managing stress. I've been doing it my whole life. The constant learning isn't a drawback for me, it's a feature. It's the only way to ensure I am constantly developing new skills and remaining relevant. So, in the end, I didn't choose IT because it was my lifelong passion. I chose it because it aligned with my practical needs and my innate curiosity for what's next. It’s a field that rewards continuous growth, and I am ready to grow with it.</p>
